# Car-Price-Guided-Project
'Exploratory data analysis with python' is a guided project I found on Cognitive Class.AI which was developed by IBM. In this project, all the categorical and continuous columns were taken into account for predicting the price of cars using data visualisation, correlation, hypothesis testing etc.
